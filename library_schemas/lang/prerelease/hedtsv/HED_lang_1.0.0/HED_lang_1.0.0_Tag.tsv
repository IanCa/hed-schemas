Original	Following https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/ (which is not an ontology for language annotation but an ontology for lexical entries in ontologies) we do not make the form of langauage inherent to language items but instead attach it separately. The word itself is a concept, but it can be expressed in multiple forms. The same is true for a sentence, phrase, clause. For some units it is more complicated, but there is a spoken form of a letter, grapheme, etc. and depending on the writing system there might be a written form of a vowel or consonant. This distinction increases flexibility

	Orthographic-type	1	Language-property		The type of unit each symbol serves to represent in written language.		Original	Classification of writing systems is complex, and these categories are not universally accepted, mainly because most writing systems have characteristics of multiple of these categories. However, most writing systems have an overall tendency towards one of these categories, and so the categories can be useful to see how large differences are managed by the individuals who speak them. But it is normal that a writing system does not cleanly fit into any of these categories.

	Derivation	1	Word-formation-function		Changing the meaning of a word, usually by adding an affix.			Derivation changes the meaning of a word, for instance, reverses the meaning, or changes intensity. We do not cover all the semantic types of changes that can be the result of morphological changes, but instead give a higher level categorization. Further specification might depend on a more semantic schema.
	Change-word-class	2	Derivation	suggestedTag=Lexical-role	Changing the word class or part of speech a word belongs to.	Derivation and (suggestedTag some Lexical-role)	Original	Combine with Lexical-role to express what the process has resulted in.
