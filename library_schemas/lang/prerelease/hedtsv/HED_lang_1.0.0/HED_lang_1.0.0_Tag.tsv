	Grapheme	1		rooted=Language-item	The smallest contrastive or meaningful unit in writing which matches either a phoneme, a syllable or a morpheme.		Original	Has different definitions, but this one is used in the domain of neuroimaging and useful as such as it is distinct from a character in an alphabetic language (letter) but useful. See Bouhani paper and https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17586801.2019.1697412 (a combined definition and interesting discussion)

Original	Following https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/ (which is not an ontology for language annotation but an ontology for lexical entries in ontologies) we do not make the form of langauage inherent to language items but instead attach it separately. The word itself is a concept, but it can be expressed in multiple forms. The same is true for a sentence, phrase, clause. For some units it is more complicated, but there is a spoken form of a letter, grapheme, etc. and depending on the writing system there might be a written form of a vowel or consonant. This distinction increases flexibility
	Written-form	3	Language-item-form	relatedTag=Canonical-written-form	The expression of a language unit through a system of writing.		Original	
	Canonical-written-form	4	Written-form		The accepted spelling of a word in a given language.		Original

	Derivation	5	Word-formation-function		Changing the meaning of a word, usually by adding an affix.			Derivation changes the meaning of a word, for instance, reverses the meaning, or changes intensity. We do not cover all the semantic types of changes that can be the result of morphological changes, but instead give a higher level categorization. Further specification might depend on a more semantic schema.
	Change-word-class	6	Derivation	suggestedTag=Lexical-role	Changing the word class or part of speech a word belongs to.		Original	Combine with Lexical-role to express what the process has resulted in. Follows Category-changer concept in GOLD, but instead of extending further HED can fulfil the same function by tagging it together with a lexical role.

	Decline	5	Inflective-morphological-function		Marking the number, case, gender, or class of nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and articles.		Original	Combine with grammatical category what the morpheme adjusted (can be multiple in aggulating languages)

	Affix	4	Morphological-position		A morpheme that is attached to a word stem to form a new word or word form.		Original	Affix is a categorization of morpheme based on its position. In OLIA this is a subclass of Morpheme. However, there are other categorizations of morphemes, based on how they change the stem of the word, which are categorized in OLIA as Morphological processes, such as Clitization, reduplication. However, since these all say something about how the morpheme is applied to the word, we believe these fit better together under the position tag.
