Amplitude varies. Best seen with eyes closed and during physical relaxation and relative mental inactivity. Blocked or attenuated by attention, especially visual, and mental effort. In adults this is the alpha rhythm, and the frequency is 8 to 13 Hz. However the frequency can be higher or lower than this range (often a supra or sub harmonic of alpha frequency) and is called alpha variant rhythm (fast and slow alpha variant rhythm).

	Biological-artifact	1	Artifact	suggestedTag=Brain-laterality, suggestedTag=Brain-region, suggestedTag=Sensors, suggestedTag=Multifocal-finding, suggestedTag=Artifact-significance-to-recording	Biological artifacts involve distinct and identifiable variations in clinical recordings arising from physiological sources, potentially affecting the interpretation of the data.	"Artifact and (suggestedTag value ""Brain-laterality"") and (suggestedTag value ""Brain-region"") and (suggestedTag value ""Sensors"") and (suggestedTag value ""Multifocal-finding"") and (suggestedTag value ""Artifact-significance-to-recording"")"
	Eye-blink-artifact	2	Biological-artifact		Example for EEG: Fp1/Fp2 become electropositive with eye closure because the cornea is positively charged causing a negative deflection in Fp1/Fp2. If the eye blink is unilateral, consider prosthetic eye. If it is in F8 rather than Fp2 then the electrodes are plugged in wrong.	
	Eye-movement-horizontal-artifact	2	Biological-artifact		Example for EEG: There is an upward deflection in the Fp2-F8 derivation, when the eyes move to the right side. In this case F8 becomes more positive and therefore. When the eyes move to the left, F7 becomes more positive and there is an upward deflection in the Fp1-F7 derivation.	
	Eye-movement-vertical-artifact	2	Biological-artifact		Example for EEG: The EEG shows positive potentials (50-100 micro V) with bi-frontal distribution, maximum at Fp1 and Fp2, when the eyeball rotated upward. The downward rotation of the eyeball was associated with the negative deflection. The time course of the deflections was similar to the time course of the eyeball movement.	
	Slow-eye-movement-artifact	2	Biological-artifact		Slow, rolling eye-movements, seen during drowsiness.	
	Nystagmus-artifact	2	Biological-artifact			
	Chewing-artifact	2	Biological-artifact			
	Sucking-artifact	2	Biological-artifact			
	Glossokinetic-artifact	2	Biological-artifact		The tongue functions as a dipole, with the tip negative with respect to the base. The artifact produced by the tongue has a broad potential field that drops from frontal to occipital areas, although it is less steep than that produced by eye movement artifacts. The amplitude of the potentials is greater inferiorly than in parasagittal regions; the frequency is variable but usually in the delta range. Chewing and sucking can produce similar artifacts.	
	Rocking-patting-artifact	2	Biological-artifact		Quasi-rhythmical artifacts in recordings from infants caused by rocking/patting.	
	Movement-artifact	2	Biological-artifact		Example for EEG: Large amplitude artifact, with irregular morphology (usually resembling a slow-wave or a wave with complex morphology) seen in one or several channels, due to movement. If the causing movement is repetitive, the artifact might resemble a rhythmic EEG activity.	
	Respiration-artifact	2	Biological-artifact		Respiration can produce 2 kinds of artifacts. One type is in the form of slow and rhythmic activity, synchronous with the body movements of respiration and mechanically affecting the impedance of (usually) one electrode. The other type can be slow or sharp waves that occur synchronously with inhalation or exhalation and involve those electrodes on which the patient is lying.	
	Pulse-artifact	2	Biological-artifact		Example for EEG: Occurs when an EEG electrode is placed over a pulsating vessel. The pulsation can cause slow waves that may simulate EEG activity. A direct relationship exists between ECG and the pulse waves (200-300 millisecond delay after ECG equals QRS complex).	
	ECG-artifact	2	Biological-artifact		Example for EEG: Far-field potential generated in the heart. The voltage and apparent surface of the artifact vary from derivation to derivation and, consequently, from montage to montage. The artifact is observed best in referential montages using earlobe electrodes A1 and A2. ECG artifact is recognized easily by its rhythmicity/regularity and coincidence with the ECG tracing.	
	Sweat-artifact	2	Biological-artifact		Is a low amplitude undulating waveform that is usually greater than 2 seconds and may appear to be an unstable baseline.	
	EMG-artifact	2	Biological-artifact		Myogenic potentials are the most common artifacts. Frontalis and temporalis muscles (ex..: clenching of jaw muscles) are common causes. Generally, the potentials generated in the muscles are of shorter duration than those generated in the brain. The frequency components are usually beyond 30-50 Hz, and the bursts are arrhythmic.	
	Non-biological-artifact	1	Artifact	suggestedTag=Artifact-significance-to-recording	Non-biological artifacts refer to anomalies in recordings introduced by external factors, potentially impacting the interpretation of the data.	"Artifact and (suggestedTag value ""Artifact-significance-to-recording"")"
	Power-supply-artifact	2	Non-biological-artifact		50-60 Hz artifact. Monomorphic waveform due to 50 or 60 Hz A/C power supply.

	Confusional-awakening	2	Sleep-related-episode		Episode of non epileptic nature included in NREM parasomnias, characterized by sudden arousal and complex behavior but without full alertness, usually lasting a few minutes and occurring almost in all children at least occasionally. Amnesia of the episode is the rule.	
	Sleep-periodic-limb-movement	2	Sleep-related-episode		PLMS. Periodic limb movement in sleep. Episodes are characterized by brief (0.5- to 5.0-second) lower-extremity movements during sleep, which typically occur at 20- to 40-second intervals, most commonly during the first 3 hours of sleep. The affected individual is usually not aware of the movements or of the transient partial arousals.	
	REM-sleep-behavioral-disorder	2	Sleep-related-episode		REM sleep behavioral disorder. Episodes characterized by: a) presence of REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) on polysomnography (PSG); b) presence of at least 1 of the following conditions - (1) Sleep-related behaviors, by history, that have been injurious, potentially injurious, or disruptive (example: dream enactment behavior); (2) abnormal REM sleep behavior documented during PSG monitoring; (3) absence of epileptiform activity on electroencephalogram (EEG) during REM sleep (unless RBD can be clearly distinguished from any concurrent REM sleep-related seizure disorder); (4) sleep disorder not better explained by another sleep disorder, a medical or neurologic disorder, a mental disorder, medication use, or a substance use disorder.	
	Sleep-walking	2	Sleep-related-episode		Episodes characterized by ambulation during sleep; the patient is difficult to arouse during an episode, and is usually amnesic following the episode. Episodes usually occur in the first third of the night during slow wave sleep. Polysomnographic recordings demonstrate 2 abnormalities during the first sleep cycle: frequent, brief, non-behavioral EEG-defined arousals prior to the somnambulistic episode and abnormally low gamma (0.75-2.0 Hz) EEG power on spectral analysis, correlating with high-voltage (hyper-synchronic gamma) waves lasting 10 to 15 s occurring just prior to the movement. This is followed by stage I NREM sleep, and there is no evidence of complete awakening.

	Hyperekplexia	2	Pediatric-episode		Disorder characterized by exaggerated startle response and hypertonicity that may occur during the first year of life and in severe cases during the neonatal period. Children usually present with marked irritability and recurrent startles in response to handling and sounds. Severely affected infants can have severe jerks and stiffening, sometimes with breath-holding spells.	
	Jactatio-capitis-nocturna	2	Pediatric-episode		Relatively common in normal children at the time of going to bed, especially during the first year of life, the rhythmic head movements persist during sleep. Usually, these phenomena disappear before 3 years of age.	
	Pavor-nocturnus	2	Pediatric-episode		A nocturnal episode characterized by age of onset of less than five years (mean age 18 months, with peak prevalence at five to seven years), appearance of signs of panic two hours after falling asleep with crying, screams, a fearful expression, inability to recognize other people including parents (for a duration of 5-15 minutes), amnesia upon awakening. Pavor nocturnus occurs in patients almost every night for months or years (but the frequency is highly variable and may be as low as once a month) and is likely to disappear spontaneously at the age of six to eight years.	
	Pediatric-stereotypical-behavior-episode	2	Pediatric-episode		Repetitive motor behavior in children, typically rhythmic and persistent; usually not paroxysmal and rarely suggest epilepsy. They include headbanging, head-rolling, jactatio capitis nocturna, body rocking, buccal or lingual movements, hand flapping and related mannerisms, repetitive hand-waving (to self-induce photosensitive seizures).

	Myoclonic-motor-seizure	4	Motor-seizure		Sudden, brief ( lower than 100 msec) involuntary single or multiple contraction(s) of muscles(s) or muscle groups of variable topography (axial, proximal limb, distal). Myoclonus is less regularly repetitive and less sustained than is clonus. Definition from ILAE 2017 Classification of Seizure Types Expanded Version	
	Negative-myoclonic-motor-seizure	4	Motor-seizure			
	Clonic-motor-seizure	4	Motor-seizure		Jerking, either symmetric or asymmetric, that is regularly repetitive and involves the same muscle groups. Definition from ILAE 2017 Classification of Seizure Types Expanded Version	
	Tonic-motor-seizure	4	Motor-seizure		A sustained increase in muscle contraction lasting a few seconds to minutes. Definition from ILAE 2017 Classification of Seizure Types Expanded Version	
	Atonic-motor-seizure	4	Motor-seizure		Sudden loss or diminution of muscle tone without apparent preceding myoclonic or tonic event lasting  about 1 to 2 s, involving head, trunk, jaw, or limb musculature. Definition from ILAE 2017 Classification of Seizure Types Expanded Version	
	Myoclonic-atonic-motor-seizure	4	Motor-seizure		A generalized seizure type with a myoclonic jerk leading to an atonic motor component. This type was previously called myoclonic astatic. Definition from ILAE 2017 Classification of Seizure Types Expanded Version	
	Myoclonic-tonic-clonic-motor-seizure	4	Motor-seizure		One or a few jerks of limbs bilaterally, followed by a tonic clonic seizure. The initial jerks can be considered to be either a brief period of clonus or myoclonus. Seizures with this characteristic are common in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Definition from ILAE 2017 Classification of Seizure Types Expanded Version	
	Tonic-clonic-motor-seizure	4	Motor-seizure		A sequence consisting of a tonic followed by a clonic phase. Definition from ILAE 2017 Classification of Seizure Types Expanded Version	
	Automatism-motor-seizure	4	Motor-seizure		A more or less coordinated motor activity usually occurring when cognition is impaired and for which the subject is usually (but not always) amnesic afterward. This often resembles a voluntary movement and may consist of an inappropriate continuation of preictal motor activity. Definition from ILAE 2017 Classification of Seizure Types Expanded Version	
	Hyperkinetic-motor-seizure	4	Motor-seizure			
	Epileptic-spasm-episode	4	Motor-seizure		A sudden flexion, extension, or mixed extension flexion of predominantly proximal and truncal muscles that is usually more sustained than a myoclonic movement but not as sustained as a tonic seizure. Limited forms may occur: Grimacing, head nodding, or subtle eye movements. Epileptic spasms frequently occur in clusters. Infantile spasms are the best known form, but spasms can occur at all ages.

Definition from ILAE 2017 Classification of Seizure Types Expanded Version	
	Cognitive-nonmotor-seizure	4	Nonmotor-seizure		Pertaining to thinking and higher cortical functions, such as language, spatial perception, memory, and praxis. The previous term for similar usage as a seizure type was psychic. Definition from ILAE 2017 Classification of Seizure Types Expanded Version	
	Autonomic-nonmotor-seizure	4	Nonmotor-seizure		A distinct alteration of autonomic nervous system function involving cardiovascular, pupillary, gastrointestinal, sudomotor, vasomotor, and thermoregulatory functions. Definition from ILAE 2017 Classification of Seizure Types Expanded Version	
	Absence-seizure	3	Seizure-classification		Absence seizures present with a sudden cessation of activity and awareness. Absence seizures tend to occur in younger age groups, have more sudden start and termination, and they usually display less complex automatisms than do focal seizures with impaired awareness, but the distinctions are not absolute. EEG information may be required for accurate classification. Definition from ILAE 2017 Classification of Seizure Types Expanded Version	
	Typical-absence-seizure	4	Absence-seizure		A sudden onset, interruption of ongoing activities, a blank stare, possibly a brief upward deviation of the eyes. Usually the patient will be unresponsive when spoken to. Duration is a few seconds to half a minute with very rapid recovery. Although not always available, an EEG would show generalized epileptiform discharges during the event. An absence seizure is by definition a seizure of generalized onset. The word is not synonymous with a blank stare, which also can be encountered with focal onset seizures. Definition from ILAE 2017 Classification of Seizure Types Expanded Version	
	Atypical-absence-seizure	4	Absence-seizure		An absence seizure with changes in tone that are more pronounced than in typical absence or the onset and/or cessation is not abrupt, often associated with slow, irregular, generalized spike-wave activity. Definition from ILAE 2017 Classification of Seizure Types Expanded Version	
	Myoclonic-absence-seizure	4	Absence-seizure		A myoclonic absence seizure refers to an absence seizure with rhythmic three-per-second myoclonic movements, causing ratcheting abduction of the upper limbs leading to progressive arm elevation, and associated with three-per-second generalized spike-wave discharges. Duration is typically 10 to 60 s. Impairment of consciousness may not be obvious. Definition from ILAE 2017 Classification of Seizure Types Expanded Version	
	Eyelid-myoclonia-absence-seizure	4	Absence-seizure		Eyelid myoclonia are myoclonic jerks of the eyelids and upward deviation of the eyes, often precipitated by closing the eyes or by light. Eyelid myoclonia can be associated with absences, but also can be motor seizures without a corresponding absence, making them difficult to categorize. The 2017 classification groups them with nonmotor (absence) seizures, which may seem counterintuitive, but the myoclonia in this instance is meant to link with absence, rather than with nonmotor.

	Seizure-semiology-manifestation	2	Episode-property		Seizure semiology refers to the clinical features or signs that are observed during a seizure, such as the type of movements or behaviors exhibited by the person having the seizure, the duration of the seizure, the level of consciousness, and any associated symptoms such as aura or postictal confusion. In other words, seizure semiology describes the physical manifestations of a seizure. Semiology is described according to the ILAE Glossary of Descriptive Terminology for Ictal Semiology (Blume et al., 2001). Besides the name, the semiologic finding can also be characterized by the somatotopic modifier, laterality, body part and centricity. Uses Location-property tags.

	Subclinical-rhythmic-EEG-discharge-adults	1	Uncertain-significant-pattern	suggestedTag=Brain-laterality, suggestedTag=Brain-region, suggestedTag=Sensors, suggestedTag=Appearance-mode, suggestedTag=Discharge-pattern	Subclinical rhythmic EEG discharge of adults (SERDA). A rhythmic pattern seen in the adult age group, mainly in the waking state or drowsiness. It consists of a mixture of frequencies, often predominant in the theta range. The onset may be fairly abrupt with widespread sharp rhythmical theta and occasionally with delta activity. As to the spatial distribution, a maximum of this discharge is usually found over the centroparietal region and especially over the vertex. It may resemble a seizure discharge but is not accompanied by any clinical signs or symptoms.

	Rhythmic-temporal-theta-burst-drowsiness	1	Uncertain-significant-pattern		Rhythmic temporal theta burst of drowsiness (RTTD). Characteristic burst of 4-7 Hz waves frequently notched by faster waves, occurring over the temporal regions of the head during drowsiness. Synonym: psychomotor variant pattern. Comment: this is a pattern of drowsiness that is of no clinical significance.	
	Temporal-slowing-elderly	1	Uncertain-significant-pattern	suggestedTag=Brain-laterality, suggestedTag=Brain-region, suggestedTag=Sensors, suggestedTag=Appearance-mode, suggestedTag=Discharge-pattern	Focal theta and/or delta activity over the temporal regions, especially the left, in persons over the age of 60. Amplitudes are low/similar to the background activity. Comment: focal temporal theta was found in 20 percent of people between the ages of 40-59 years, and 40 percent of people between 60 and 79 years. One third of people older than 60 years had focal temporal delta activity.
