'''Prologue'''
This schema is a Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED) Library Schema implementation of Standardized Computer-based Organized Reporting of EEG (SCORE)(1-2) for describing events occurring during neuroimaging time series recordings.
The HED-SCORE library schema allows clinical and and scientists to annotate electrophysiology recordings using terms from an internationally accepted set of defined terms (SCORE) compatible with the HED framework .
The resulting annotations are understandable to clinicians and directly usable in computer analysis.

Future extensions may be implemented in the HED-SCORE library schema.

** Sleep-walking <nowiki>[Episodes characterized by ambulation during sleep; the patient is difficult to arouse during an episode, and is usually amnesic following the episode. Episodes usually occur in the first third of the night during slow wave sleep. Polysomnographic recordings demonstrate 2 abnormalities during the first sleep cycle: frequent, brief, non-behavioral EEG-defined arousals prior to the somnambulistic episode and abnormally low gamma (0.75-2.0 Hz) EEG power on spectral analysis, correlating with high-voltage (hyper-synchronic gamma) waves lasting 10 to 15 s occurring just prior to the movement.

* Non-reactive-sleep <nowiki>[EEG activity consisting of normal sleep graphoelements, but which cannot be interrupted by external stimuli/ the patient cannot be wakened. (Source: Beniczky ea 2013, Appendix S3; Beniczky ea 2017, Section 7.)]</nowiki>

'''Uncertain-significant-pattern''' <nowiki>[EEG graphoelements or rhythms that resemble abnormal patterns but that are not necessarily associated with a pathology, and the physician does not consider them abnormal in the context of the scored recording (like normal variants and patterns). (Source: Beniczky ea 2013, Appendix S1; Beniczky ea 2017, Table 14.)]</nowiki>
* Sharp-transient-pattern <nowiki>{suggestedTag=Categorical-location-value, suggestedTag=Sensors, suggestedTag=Appearance-mode, suggestedTag=Discharge-pattern} [Sharp transient. (Source: Beniczky ea 2017, Table 14.)]</nowiki>
* Wicket-spikes <nowiki>[Spike-like monophasic negative single waves or trains of waves occurring over the temporal regions during drowsiness that have an arcuate or mu-like appearance. These are mainly seen in older individuals and represent a benign variant that is of little clinical significance. (Source: Beniczky ea 2013, Appendix S6; Beniczky ea 2017, Table 14.)]</nowiki>
* Small-sharp-spikes <nowiki>{suggestedTag=Categorical-location-value, suggestedTag=Sensors, suggestedTag=Appearance-mode, suggestedTag=Discharge-pattern} [Benign Epileptiform Transients of Sleep (BETS). Small Sharp Spikes (SSS) of very short duration and low amplitude, often followed by a small theta wave, occurring in the temporal regions during drowsiness and light sleep. They occur on one or both sides (often asynchronously). The main negative and positive components are of about equally spiky character. Rarely seen in children, they are seen most often in adults and the elderly. Two thirds of the patients have a history of epileptic seizures. (Source: Beniczky ea 2013, Appendix S6; Beniczky ea 2017, Table 14.)]</nowiki>
* Fourteen-six-Hz-positive-burst <nowiki>{suggestedTag=Categorical-location-value, suggestedTag=Sensors, suggestedTag=Appearance-mode, suggestedTag=Discharge-pattern} [Burst of arch-shaped waves at 13-17 Hz and/or 5-7-Hz but most commonly at 14 and/or 6 Hz seen generally over the posterior temporal and adjacent areas of one or both sides of the head during sleep. The sharp peaks of its component waves are positive with respect to other regions. Amplitude varies but is generally below 75  micro V. Comments: (1) best demonstrated by referential recording using contralateral earlobe or other remote, reference electrodes. (2) This pattern has no established clinical significance. (Source: Beniczky ea 2013, Appendix S6; Beniczky ea 2017, Table 14.)]</nowiki>
* Six-Hz-spike-slow-wave <nowiki>{suggestedTag=Categorical-location-value, suggestedTag=Sensors, suggestedTag=Appearance-mode, suggestedTag=Discharge-pattern} [Spike and slow wave complexes at 4-7 Hz, but mostly at 6 Hz occurring generally in brief bursts bilaterally and synchronously, symmetrically or asymmetrically, and either confined to or of larger amplitude over the posterior or anterior regions of the head. The spike has a strong positive component. Amplitude varies but is generally smaller than that of spike-and slow-wave complexes repeating at slower rates. Comment: this pattern should be distinguished from epileptiform discharges. Synonym: wave and spike phantom. (Source: Beniczky ea 2013, Appendix S6; Beniczky ea 2017, Table 14.)]</nowiki>
* Rudimentary-spike-wave-complex <nowiki>{suggestedTag=Categorical-location-value, suggestedTag=Sensors, suggestedTag=Appearance-mode, suggestedTag=Discharge-pattern} [Synonym: pseudo petit mal discharge. Paroxysmal discharge that consists of generalized or nearly generalized high voltage 3 to 4/sec waves with poorly developed spike in the positive trough between the slow waves, occurring in drowsiness only. It is found only in infancy and early childhood when marked hypnagogic rhythmical theta activity is paramount in the drowsy state. (Source: Beniczky ea 2013, Appendix S6; Beniczky ea 2017, Table 14.)]</nowiki>
* Slow-fused-transient <nowiki>{suggestedTag=Categorical-location-value, suggestedTag=Sensors, suggestedTag=Appearance-mode, suggestedTag=Discharge-pattern} [A posterior slow-wave preceded by a sharp-contoured potential that blends together with the ensuing slow wave, in children.

* Needle-like-occipital-spikes-blind <nowiki>{suggestedTag=Categorical-location-value, suggestedTag=Sensors, suggestedTag=Appearance-mode, suggestedTag=Discharge-pattern} [Spike discharges of a particularly fast and needle-like character develop over the occipital region in most congenitally blind children. Completely disappear during childhood or adolescence. (Source: Beniczky ea 2013, Appendix S6; Beniczky ea 2017, Table 14.)]</nowiki>
* Subclinical-rhythmic-EEG-discharge-adults <nowiki>{suggestedTag=Categorical-location-value, suggestedTag=Sensors, suggestedTag=Appearance-mode, suggestedTag=Discharge-pattern} [Subclinical Rhythmic EEG Discharge of Adults (SERDA). A rhythmic pattern seen in adults, mainly in the waking state or drowsiness. It consists of a mixture of frequencies, often predominant in the theta range. The onset may be fairly abrupt with widespread sharp rhythmical theta and occasionally with delta activity. As to the spatial distribution, a maximum of this discharge is usually found over the centroparietal region and especially over the vertex. It may resemble a seizure discharge but is not accompanied by any clinical signs or symptoms. (Source: Beniczky ea 2013, Appendix S6; Beniczky ea 2017, Table 14.)]</nowiki>
* Rhythmic-temporal-theta-burst-drowsiness <nowiki>[Rhythmic temporal theta burst of drowsiness (RTTD). Characteristic burst of 4-7 Hz waves frequently notched by faster waves, occurring over the temporal regions of the head during drowsiness. Synonym: psychomotor variant pattern. Comment: this is a pattern of drowsiness that is of no clinical significance. (Source: Beniczky ea 2013, Appendix S6; Beniczky ea 2017, Table 14.)]</nowiki>

Amplitudes are low/similar to the background activity. Comment: focal temporal theta was found in 20 percent of people between the ages of 40-59 years, and 40 percent of people between 60 and 79 years. One third of people older than 60 years had focal temporal delta activity. (Source: Beniczky ea 2013, Appendix S6; Beniczky ea 2017, Table 14.)]</nowiki>
* Breach-rhythm <nowiki>{suggestedTag=Categorical-location-value, suggestedTag=Sensors, suggestedTag=Appearance-mode, suggestedTag=Discharge-pattern} [Rhythmical activity recorded over cranial bone defects.

'''Epilogue'''
The Standardized Computer-based Organized Reporting of EEG (SCORE) is a standard terminology for scalp EEG data assessment designed for use in clinical practice that may also be used for research purposes.
The SCORE standard defines terms for describing phenomena observed in scalp EEG data. It is also potentially applicable (with some suitable extensions) to EEG recorded in critical care and neonatal settings.
The SCORE standard received European consensus and has been endorsed by the European Chapter of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN) and the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Commission on European Affairs.
A second revised and extended version of SCORE achieved international consensus.
