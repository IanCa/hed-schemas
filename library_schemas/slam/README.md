# HED SLAM Schema

The SLAM (Sensor Location and Motion) schema is an extension of the Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED) base schema,
designed to standardize the annotation of sensor locations and human motion across recording modalities
and diverse fields such as biomechanics, kinesiology, human-machine interaction, physical therapy,
and mobile brain/body imaging. By providing a unified vocabulary for describing anatomical landmarks,
sensor placements, and movement-related metrics, SLAM aims to facilitate data sharing,
improve cross-study comparability, and enhance result interpretation across different experimental
setups and research domains.

This standardization will foster interdisciplinary collaboration and advance our understanding of
human motion and its measurement.
