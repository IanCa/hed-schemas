            * Posterior-dominant-rhythm <nowiki>[Rhythmic activity occurring during wakefulness over the posterior regions of the head, generally with maximum amplitudes over the occipital areas. Amplitude varies. Best seen with eyes closed and during physical relaxation and relative mental inactivity. Blocked or attenuated by attention, especially visual, and mental effort. In adults this is the alpha rhythm, and the frequency is 8 to 13 Hz. However the frequency can be higher or lower than this range (often a supra or sub harmonic of alpha frequency) and is called alpha variant rhythm (fast and slow alpha variant rhythm). In children, the normal range of the frequency of the posterior dominant rhythm is age-dependant.]</nowiki>
