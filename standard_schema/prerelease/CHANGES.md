## Changes proposed for 8.3.0

- Description of the `rooted` schema attribute corrected to agree with specification. 
- Other schema attribute descriptions revised for conciseness.  
- `Clock-face` under `Clock` is deprecated as it can be confused with Clockface.
- Corrected typo audo --> audio in the description of `Media`.  
- Added `Ride` under `Perform` as requested for COCO annotation.  
- Added `year` as a new time unit.
- Added the `Is-about` tag to conform to NIMD.
- Added `Metadata-identifier` under `Metadata` and moved `CogAtlas`, `CogPo`,
`OBO-identifer`, `Subject-identifer`, `Version-identifer` under this tag.
- Added `UUID` under `Metadata-identifier`.
- Added `URL` under `Metadata`.
