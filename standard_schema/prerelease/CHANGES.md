## Changes proposed for 8.3.0

- Description of the `rooted` schema attribute corrected to agree with specification. 
- Other schema attribute descriptions revised for conciseness.  
- `Clock-face` under `Clock` is deprecated as it can be confused with Clockface.
- Corrected typo audo --> audio in the description of `Media`.  
- Added `Ride` under `Perform` as requested for COCO annotation.
