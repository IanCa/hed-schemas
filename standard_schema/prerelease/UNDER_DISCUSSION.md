### Under discussion for 8.2.0


1. Proposed: adding `with-standard` in schema header to indicate a library schema that is partnered with a standard schema. (Other schema attributes are `library` and `version`).
2. Proposed: adding a `reserved` schema attribute to indicate reserved words.  (Only the standard schema could have `reserved`.)
3. Proposed: added a `history` schema attribute that keeps the history such as when a node is added, moved, or deprecated.
4. Proposed add a schema property for an attribute that is to be `inherited`. This would be added to `extensionAllowed`, `suggestedTag`, and `relatedTag`.
