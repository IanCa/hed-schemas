'''Prologue'''
This schema is Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED) Library Schema implementation for Standardized Computer-based Organized Reporting of EEG: SCORE based on the first official release that includes an xsd and requires unit class, unit modifier, value class, schema attribute and property sections.
Data sharing using standard definitions enables applications of automated tools to optimize analyses, reduce errors, and ultimately to advance the understanding of the human brain.
This implementation of SCORE in an open-source, machine-readable format using HED to enables its use in machine analysis and mega-analysis.

Amplitude varies. Best seen with eyes closed and during physical relaxation and relative mental inactivity. Blocked or attenuated by attention, especially visual, and mental effort. In adults this is the alpha rhythm, and the frequency is 8 to 13 Hz. However the frequency can be higher or lower than this range (often a supra or sub harmonic of alpha frequency) and is called alpha variant rhythm (fast and slow alpha variant rhythm). In children, the normal range of the frequency of the posterior dominant rhythm is age-dependant.]</nowiki>
            * Mu-rhythm <nowiki>[EEG rhythm at 7-11 Hz composed of arch-shaped waves occurring over the central or centro-parietal regions of the scalp during wakefulness.

Although some subtle seizures are associated with rhythmic ictal EEG discharges , and are clearly epileptic, ictal EEG often does not show typical epileptic activity] </nowiki>
            * Electrographic-seizure <nowiki> [Referred usually to non convulsive status. Ictal EEG: rhythmic discharge or spike and wave pattern with definite evolution in frequency, location, or morphology lasting at least 10 s; evolution in amplitude alone did not qualify] </nowiki>

                ** Sleep-PLMS <nowiki> [Periodic limb movement in sleep. Episodes characterized by brief (0.5- to 5.0-second) lower-extremity movements during sleep, which typically occur at 20- to 40-second intervals, most commonly during the first 3 hours of sleep.

                ** Sleep-walking <nowiki> [Episodes characterized by ambulation during sleep; the patient is difficult to arouse during an episode, and is usually amnesic following the episode. Episodes usually occur in the first third of the night during slow wave sleep. Polysomnographic recordings demonstrate 2 abnormalities during the first sleep cycle: frequent, brief, nonbehavioral EEG-defined arousals prior to the somnambulistic episode and abnormally low gamma (0.75-2.0 Hz) EEG power on spectral analysis, correlating with high-voltage (hypersynchronic gamma) waves lasting 10 to 15 s occurring just prior to the movement. This is followed by stage I NREM sleep, and there is no evidence of complete awakening.] </nowiki>
            * Pediatric-episodes
                ** Hyperekplexia <nowiki> [Disorder characterized by exaggerated startle response and hypertonicity that may occur during the first year of life and in severe cases during the neonatal period.

Severely affected infants can have severe jerks and stiffening, sometimes with breathholding spells.] </nowiki>
                ** Jactatio-capitis-nocturna <nowiki> [Relatively common in normal children at the time of going to bed, especially during the first year of life, the rhythmic head movements persist during sleep. Usually, these phenomena disappear before 3 years of age.] </nowiki>

Pavor nocturnus occurs in patients almost every night for months or years (but the frequency is highly variable and may be as low as once a month) and is likely to disappear spontaneously at the age of six to eight years. ] </nowiki>
                ** Stereotypical-behavior <nowiki> [Repetitive motor behavior in children, typically rhythmic and persistent; usually not paroxysmal and rarely suggest epilepsy. They include headbanging, head-rolling, jactatio capitis nocturna, body rocking, buccal or lingual movements, hand flapping and related mannerisms, repetitive hand-waving (to self-induce photosensitive seizures). ] </nowiki>

            * Paroxysmal-motor-event <nowiki> [Paroxysmal phenomena during neonatal or childhood periods characterized by recurrent motor or behavioural signs or symptoms that must be distinguishes from epileptic disorders. ] </nowiki>
            * Syncope <nowiki> [Episode with loss of consciousness and muscle tone that is abrupt in onset, of short duration and followed by rapid recovery; it occurs in response to transient impairment of cerebral perfusion. Typical prodromal symptoms often herald onset of syncope and postictal symptoms are minimal. Syncopal convulsions resulting from cerebral anoxia are common but are not a form of epilepsy, nor are there any accompanying EEG ictal discharges. ] </nowiki>
            * Cataplexy <nowiki> [A sudden decrement in muscle tone and loss of deep tendon reflexes, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, or postural collapse. Cataplexy usually is precipitated by an outburst of emotional expression-notably laughter, anger, or startle. It is one of the tetrad of symptoms of narcolepsy. During cataplexy, respiration and voluntary eye movements are not compromised. Consciousness is preserved.] </nowiki>

            * Slow-alpha-variant-rhythm <nowiki> [Characteristic rhythms mostly at 4-5 Hz, recorded most prominently over the posterior regions of the head. Generally alternate, or are intermixed, with alpha rhythm to which they often are harmonically related. Amplitude varies but is frequently close to 50 micro V. Blocked or attenuated by attention, especially visual, and mental effort.

            * Photic-driving <nowiki> [Physiologic response consisting of rhythmic activity elicited over the posterior regions of the head by repetitive photic stimulation at frequencies of about 5-30 Hz. Comments: term should be limited to activity time-locked to the stimulus and of frequency identical or harmonically related to the stimulus frequency. Photic driving should be distinguished from the visual evoked potentials elicited by isolated flashes of light or flashes repeated at very low frequency.] </nowiki>
            * Photomyogenic-response <nowiki> [A response to intermittent photic stimulation characterized by the appearance in the record of brief, repetitive muscular artifacts (spikes) over the anterior regions of the head. These often increase gradually in amplitude as stimuli are continued and cease promptly when the stimulus is withdrawn. Comment: this response is frequently associated with flutter of the eyelids and vertical oscillations of the eyeballs and sometimes with discrete jerking mostly involving the musculature of the face and head.

            * Biological-artifacts <nowiki> [Used with Findings-property/ tags]</nowiki>
                ** Eye-blinks <nowiki>[Fp1/Fp2 become electropositive with eye closure because the cornea is positively charged causing a negative deflection in Fp1/Fp2. If the eye blink is unilateral, consider prosthetic eye. If it is in F8 rather than Fp2 then the electrodes are plugged in wrong.]</nowiki> 
                ** Eye-movements-horizontal <nowiki> [There is an upward deflection in the Fp2-F8 derivation, when the eyes move to the right side. In this case F8 becomes more positive and therefore. When the eyes move to the left, F7 becomes more positive and there is an upward deflection in the Fp1-F7 derivation.] </nowiki>
                ** Eye-movements-vertical <nowiki> [The EEG shows positive potentials (50-100 micro V) with bifrontal distribution, maximum at Fp1 and Fp2, when the eyeball rotated upward.

The artifact produced by the tongue has a broad potential field that drops from frontal to occipital areas, although it is less steep than that produced by eye movement artifacts. The amplitude of the potentials is greater inferiorly than in parasagittal regions; the frequency is variable but usually in the delta range. Chewing and sucking can produce similar artifacts.] </nowiki>

                ** Movement-artifact <nowiki> [Large amplitude artifact, with irregular morphology (usually resembling a slow-wave or a wave with complex morphology) seen in one or several channels, due to movement. If the causing movement is repetitive, the artifact might resemble a rhythmic EEG activity.] </nowiki>
                ** Respiration-artifact <nowiki> [Respiration can produce 2 kinds of artifacts. One type is in the form of slow and rhythmic activity, synchronous with the body movements of respiration and mechanically affecting the impedance of (usually) one electrode. The other type can be slow or sharp waves that occur synchronously with inhalation or exhalation and involve those electrodes on which the patient is lying.] </nowiki>
                ** Pulse-artifact <nowiki> [Occurs when an EEG electrode is placed over a pulsating vessel. The pulsation can cause slow waves that may simulate EEG activity. A direct relationship exists between ECG and the pulse waves (200-300 millisecond delay after ECG equals QRS complex).]</nowiki>
                ** ECG-artifact <nowiki> [Far-field potential generated in the heart. The voltage and apparent surface of the artifact vary from derivation to derivation and, consequently, from montage to montage. The artifact is observed best in referential montages using earlobe electrodes A1 and A2. ECG artifact is recognized easily by its rhythmicity/regularity and coincidence with the ECG tracing.] </nowiki>
                ** Sweat-artifact <nowiki> [Is a low amplitude undulating waveform that is usually greater than 2 seconds and may appear to be an unstable baseline.] </nowiki>
                ** EMG0artifact <nowiki> [Myogenic potentials are the most common artifacts. Frontalis and temporalis muscles (ex..: clenching of jaw muscles) are common causes. Generally, the potentials generated in the muscles are of shorter duration than those generated in the brain. The frequency components are usually beyond 30-50 Hz, and the bursts are arrhythmic.] </nowiki>
