'''Prologue'''
This schema is Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED) Library Schema implementation for Standardized Computer-based Organized Reporting of EEG: SCORE based on the first official release that includes an xsd and requires unit class, unit modifier, value class, schema attribute and property sections.
Data sharing using standard definitions enables applications of automated tools to optimize analyses, reduce errors, and ultimately to advance the understanding of the human brain.
This implementation of SCORE in an open-source, machine-readable format using HED to enables its use in machine analysis and mega-analysis.

'''Modulators''' <nowiki>[External stimuli / interventions or changes in the alertness level (sleep) that modify: the background activity, or how often a graphoelement is occurring, or change other features of the graphoelement (like intra-burst frequency).

Amplitude varies. Best seen with eyes closed and during physical relaxation and relative mental inactivity. Blocked or attenuated by attention, especially visual, and mental effort. In adults this is the alpha rhythm, and the frequency is 8 to 13 Hz. However the frequency can be higher or lower than this range (often a supra or sub harmonic of alpha frequency) and is called alpha variant rhythm (fast and slow alpha variant rhythm). In children, the normal range of the frequency of the posterior dominant rhythm is age-dependant.]</nowiki>

Although some subtle seizures are associated with rhythmic ictal EEG discharges , and are clearly epileptic, ictal EEG often does not show typical epileptic activity] </nowiki>
    * Electrographic-seizure <nowiki>[Referred usually to non convulsive status. Ictal EEG: rhythmic discharge or spike and wave pattern with definite evolution in frequency, location, or morphology lasting at least 10 s; evolution in amplitude alone did not qualify] </nowiki>

Episodes usually occur in the first third of the night during slow wave sleep. Polysomnographic recordings demonstrate 2 abnormalities during the first sleep cycle: frequent, brief, non-behavioral EEG-defined arousals prior to the somnambulistic episode and abnormally low gamma (0.75-2.0 Hz) EEG power on spectral analysis, correlating with high-voltage (hyper-synchronic gamma) waves lasting 10 to 15 s occurring just prior to the movement.

They include headbanging, head-rolling, jactatio capitis nocturna, body rocking, buccal or lingual movements, hand flapping and related mannerisms, repetitive hand-waving (to self-induce photosensitive seizures). ] </nowiki>

    * Paroxysmal-motor-event <nowiki>[Paroxysmal phenomena during neonatal or childhood periods characterized by recurrent motor or behavioral signs or symptoms that must be distinguishes from epileptic disorders. ] </nowiki>
    * Syncope <nowiki>[Episode with loss of consciousness and muscle tone that is abrupt in onset, of short duration and followed by rapid recovery; it occurs in response to transient impairment of cerebral perfusion. Typical prodromal symptoms often herald onset of syncope and postictal symptoms are minimal. Syncopal convulsions resulting from cerebral anoxia are common but are not a form of epilepsy, nor are there any accompanying EEG ictal discharges. ] </nowiki>
    * Cataplexy <nowiki>[A sudden decrement in muscle tone and loss of deep tendon reflexes, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, or postural collapse. Cataplexy usually is precipitated by an outburst of emotional expression-notably laughter, anger, or startle. It is one of the tetrad of symptoms of narcolepsy.

    * Rhythmic-activity-patterns <nowiki>[Not further specified] </nowiki>
    * Slow-alpha-variant-rhythm <nowiki>[Characteristic rhythms mostly at 4-5 Hz, recorded most prominently over the posterior regions of the head. Generally alternate, or are intermixed, with alpha rhythm to which they often are harmonically related. Amplitude varies but is frequently close to 50 micro V. Blocked or attenuated by attention, especially visual, and mental effort. Comment: slow alpha variant rhythms should be distinguished from posterior slow waves characteristic of children and adolescents and occasionally seen in young adults.] </nowiki>

    * Biological-artifact <nowiki>[Used with Findings-property/ tags]</nowiki>
        ** Eye-blinks-artifact <nowiki>[Fp1/Fp2 become electropositive with eye closure because the cornea is positively charged causing a negative deflection in Fp1/Fp2. If the eye blink is unilateral, consider prosthetic eye. If it is in F8 rather than Fp2 then the electrodes are plugged in wrong.]</nowiki>
        ** Eye-movements-horizontal-artifact <nowiki>[There is an upward deflection in the Fp2-F8 derivation, when the eyes move to the right side. In this case F8 becomes more positive and therefore. When the eyes move to the left, F7 becomes more positive and there is an upward deflection in the Fp1-F7 derivation.] </nowiki>
        ** Eye-movements-vertical-artifact <nowiki>[The EEG shows positive potentials (50-100 micro V) with bi-frontal distribution, maximum at Fp1 and Fp2, when the eyeball rotated upward. The downward rotation of the eyeball was associated with the negative deflection. The time course of the deflections was similar to the time course of the eyeball movement.]</nowiki>
        ** Slow-eye-movements-artifact <nowiki>[Slow, rolling eye-movements, seen during drowsiness.]</nowiki>

        ** Chewing-artifact
        ** Sucking-artifact
        ** Glossokinetic-artifact <nowiki>[The tongue functions as a dipole, with the tip negative with respect to the base. The artifact produced by the tongue has a broad potential field that drops from frontal to occipital areas, although it is less steep than that produced by eye movement artifacts. The amplitude of the potentials is greater inferiorly than in parasagittal regions; the frequency is variable but usually in the delta range. Chewing and sucking can produce similar artifacts.] </nowiki>
        ** Rocking-patting-artifact <nowiki>[Quasi-rhythmical artifacts in recordings from infants caused by rocking/ patting.]</nowiki>
        ** Movement-artifact <nowiki>[Large amplitude artifact, with irregular morphology (usually resembling a slow-wave or a wave with complex morphology) seen in one or several channels, due to movement. If the causing movement is repetitive, the artifact might resemble a rhythmic EEG activity.] </nowiki>
        ** Respiration-artifact <nowiki>[Respiration can produce 2 kinds of artifacts. One type is in the form of slow and rhythmic activity, synchronous with the body movements of respiration and mechanically affecting the impedance of (usually) one electrode. The other type can be slow or sharp waves that occur synchronously with inhalation or exhalation and involve those electrodes on which the patient is lying.] </nowiki>
        ** Pulse-artifact <nowiki>[Occurs when an EEG electrode is placed over a pulsating vessel. The pulsation can cause slow waves that may simulate EEG activity. A direct relationship exists between ECG and the pulse waves (200-300 millisecond delay after ECG equals QRS complex).]</nowiki>
        ** ECG-artifact <nowiki>[Far-field potential generated in the heart. The voltage and apparent surface of the artifact vary from derivation to derivation and, consequently, from montage to montage. The artifact is observed best in referential montages using earlobe electrodes A1 and A2. ECG artifact is recognized easily by its rhythmicity/regularity and coincidence with the ECG tracing.] </nowiki>
        ** Sweat-artifact <nowiki>[Is a low amplitude undulating waveform that is usually greater than 2 seconds and may appear to be an unstable baseline.] </nowiki>
        ** EMG-artifact <nowiki>[Myogenic potentials are the most common artifacts. Frontalis and temporalis muscles (ex..: clenching of jaw muscles) are common causes. Generally, the potentials generated in the muscles are of shorter duration than those generated in the brain.

Normally the allowed characters are listed individually. However, the word letters designates the upper and lower case alphabetic characters and the word digits designates the digits 0-9. The word blank designates the blank character.]</nowiki>
    * defaultUnits <nowiki>{unitClassProperty}[A schema attribute of unit classes specifying the default units to use if the placeholder has a unit class but the substituted value has no units.]</nowiki>
    * extensionAllowed <nowiki>{boolProperty}[A schema attribute indicating that users can add unlimited levels of child nodes under this tag. This tag is propagated to child nodes with the exception of the hashtag placeholders.]</nowiki>
    * recommended  <nowiki>{boolProperty}[A schema attribute indicating that the event-level HED string should include this tag.]</nowiki>
    * relatedTag <nowiki>[A schema attribute suggesting HED tags that are closely related to this tag. This attribute is used by tagging tools.]</nowiki>
    * requireChild  <nowiki>{boolProperty}[A schema attribute indicating that one of the node elements descendants must be included when using this tag.]</nowiki>
    * required <nowiki>{boolProperty}[A schema attribute indicating that every event-level HED string should include this tag.]</nowiki>
    * SIUnit  <nowiki>{boolProperty, unitProperty}[A schema attribute indicating that this unit element is an SI unit and can be modified by multiple and submultiple names. Note that some units such as byte are designated as SI units although they are not part of the standard.]</nowiki>
    * SIUnitModifier <nowiki>{boolProperty, unitModifierProperty}[A schema attribute indicating that this SI unit modifier represents a multiple or submultiple of a base unit rather than a unit symbol.]</nowiki>
    * SIUnitSymbolModifier <nowiki>{boolProperty, unitModifierProperty}[A schema attribute indicating that this SI unit modifier represents a multiple or submultiple of a unit symbol rather than a base symbol.]</nowiki>
    * suggestedTag <nowiki>[A schema attribute that indicates another tag  that is often associated with this tag. This attribute is used by tagging tools to provide tagging suggestions.]</nowiki>
    * tagGroup <nowiki>{boolProperty}[A schema attribute indicating the tag can only appear inside a tag group.] </nowiki>
    * takesValue <nowiki>{boolProperty}[A schema attribute indicating the tag is a hashtag placeholder that is expected to be replaced with a user-defined value.] </nowiki>
    * topLevelTagGroup <nowiki>{boolProperty}[A schema attribute indicating that this tag (or its descendants) can only appear in a top-level tag group.] </nowiki>
    * unique <nowiki>{boolProperty}[A schema attribute indicating that only one of this tag or its descendants can be used  in the event-level HED string.]</nowiki>
    * unitClass <nowiki>[A schema attribute specifying which unit class this value tag belongs to.]</nowiki>
    * unitPrefix <nowiki>{boolProperty, unitProperty}[A schema attribute applied specifically to unit elements to designate that the unit indicator is a prefix (e.g., dollar sign in the currency units).]</nowiki>
    * unitSymbol <nowiki>{boolProperty, unitProperty}[A schema attribute indicating this tag is an abbreviation or symbol representing a type of unit. Unit symbols represent both the singular and the plural and thus cannot be pluralized.]</nowiki>
    * valueClass <nowiki>[A schema attribute specifying which value class this value tag belongs to.]</nowiki>

'''Properties''' <nowiki>[Properties of the schema attributes themselves. These are used for schema handling and verification.]</nowiki>
    * boolProperty <nowiki>[Indicates that the schema attribute represents something that is either true or false and does not have a value. Attributes without this value are assumed to have string values.]</nowiki>
    * unitClassProperty <nowiki>[Indicates that the schema attribute is meant to be applied to unit classes.]</nowiki>
    * unitModifierProperty <nowiki>[Indicates that the schema attribute is meant to be applied to unit modifier classes.]</nowiki>
    * unitProperty <nowiki>[Indicates that the schema attribute is meant to be applied to units within a unit class.]</nowiki>
    * valueClassProperty <nowiki>[Indicates that the schema attribute is meant to be applied to value classes.]</nowiki>
