'''Prologue'''
This schema is Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED) Library Schema implementation for Standardized Computer-based Organized Reporting of EEG: SCORE based on the first official release that includes an xsd and requires unit class, unit modifier, value class, schema attribute and property sections.
Data sharing using standard definitions enables applications of automated tools to optimize analyses, reduce errors, and ultimately to advance the understanding of the human brain.
This implementation of SCORE in an open-source, machine-readable format using HED to enables its use in machine analysis and mega-analysis.

'''Background-activity''' <nowiki> [An EEG activity representing the setting in which a given normal or abnormal pattern appears and from which such pattern is distinguished.]</nowiki>

    * Posterior-dominant-rhythm <nowiki>[Rhythmic activity occurring during wakefulness over the posterior regions of the head, generally with maximum amplitudes over the occipital areas. Amplitude varies. Best seen with eyes closed and during physical relaxation and relative mental inactivity. Blocked or attenuated by attention, especially visual, and mental effort. In adults this is the alpha rhythm, and the frequency is 8 to 13 Hz. However the frequency can be higher or lower than this range (often a supra or sub harmonic of alpha frequency) and is called alpha variant rhythm (fast and slow alpha variant rhythm). In children, the normal range of the frequency of the posterior dominant rhythm is age-dependant.]</nowiki>
    * Mu-rhythm <nowiki>[EEG rhythm at 7-11 Hz composed of arch-shaped waves occurring over the central or centro-parietal regions of the scalp during wakefulness. Amplitudes varies but is mostly below 50 microV. Blocked or attenuated most clearly by contralateral movement, thought of movement, readiness to move or tactile stimulation.]</nowiki>
    * Other-organized-rhythms <nowiki>[EEG activity that consisting of waves of approximately constant period, which is considered as part of the background (ongoing) activity, but does not fulfil the criteria of the posterior dominant rhythm.]</nowiki>

Although some subtle seizures are associated with rhythmic ictal EEG discharges , and are clearly epileptic, ictal EEG often does not show typical epileptic activity] </nowiki>
    * Electrographic-seizure <nowiki> [Referred usually to non convulsive status. Ictal EEG: rhythmic discharge or spike and wave pattern with definite evolution in frequency, location, or morphology lasting at least 10 s; evolution in amplitude alone did not qualify] </nowiki>

Amnesia of the episode is the rule.] </nowiki>
        ** Sleep-PLMS <nowiki> [Periodic limb movement in sleep. Episodes characterized by brief (0.5- to 5.0-second) lower-extremity movements during sleep, which typically occur at 20- to 40-second intervals, most commonly during the first 3 hours of sleep. The affected individual is usually not aware of the movements or of the transient partial arousals.] </nowiki>
        ** RBD <nowiki> [REM sleep behavioral disorder. Episodes characterized by: a) presence of REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) on polysomnography (PSG); b) presence of at least 1 of the following conditions - (1) Sleep-related behaviors, by history, that have been injurious, potentially injurious, or disruptive (example: dream enactment behavior); (2) abnormal REM sleep behavior documented during PSG monitoring; (3) absence of epileptiform activity on electroencephalogram (EEG) during REM sleep (unless RBD can be clearly distinguished from any concurrent REM sleep-related seizure disorder); (4) sleep disorder not better explained by another sleep disorder, a medical or neurologic disorder, a mental disorder, medication use, or a substance use disorder.] </nowiki>
        ** Sleep-walking <nowiki> [Episodes characterized by ambulation during sleep; the patient is difficult to arouse during an episode, and is usually amnesic following the episode. Episodes usually occur in the first third of the night during slow wave sleep. Polysomnographic recordings demonstrate 2 abnormalities during the first sleep cycle: frequent, brief, nonbehavioral EEG-defined arousals prior to the somnambulistic episode and abnormally low gamma (0.75-2.0 Hz) EEG power on spectral analysis, correlating with high-voltage (hypersynchronic gamma) waves lasting 10 to 15 s occurring just prior to the movement. This is followed by stage I NREM sleep, and there is no evidence of complete awakening.] </nowiki>
    * Pediatric-episodes
        ** Hyperekplexia <nowiki> [Disorder characterized by exaggerated startle response and hypertonicity that may occur during the first year of life and in severe cases during the neonatal period.

        ** Jactatio-capitis-nocturna <nowiki> [Relatively common in normal children at the time of going to bed, especially during the first year of life, the rhythmic head movements persist during sleep. Usually, these phenomena disappear before 3 years of age.] </nowiki>
        ** Pavor-nocturnus <nowiki> [Nocturnal episodes characterized by age of onset of less than five years (mean age 18 months, with peak prevalence at five to seven years), appearance of signs of panic two hours after falling asleep with crying, screams, a fearful expression, inability to recognize other people including parents (for a duration of 5-15 minutes), amnesia upon awakening. Pavor nocturnus occurs in patients almost every night for months or years (but the frequency is highly variable and may be as low as once a month) and is likely to disappear spontaneously at the age of six to eight years. ] </nowiki>
        ** Stereotypical-behavior <nowiki> [Repetitive motor behavior in children, typically rhythmic and persistent; usually not paroxysmal and rarely suggest epilepsy. They include headbanging, head-rolling, jactatio capitis nocturna, body rocking, buccal or lingual movements, hand flapping and related mannerisms, repetitive hand-waving (to self-induce photosensitive seizures). ] </nowiki>

    * Paroxysmal-motor-event <nowiki> [Paroxysmal phenomena during neonatal or childhood periods characterized by recurrent motor or behavioural signs or symptoms that must be distinguishes from epileptic disorders. ] </nowiki>
    * Syncope <nowiki> [Episode with loss of consciousness and muscle tone that is abrupt in onset, of short duration and followed by rapid recovery; it occurs in response to transient impairment of cerebral perfusion. Typical prodromal symptoms often herald onset of syncope and postictal symptoms are minimal. Syncopal convulsions resulting from cerebral anoxia are common but are not a form of epilepsy, nor are there any accompanying EEG ictal discharges. ] </nowiki>
    * Cataplexy <nowiki> [A sudden decrement in muscle tone and loss of deep tendon reflexes, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, or postural collapse. Cataplexy usually is precipitated by an outburst of emotional expression-notably laughter, anger, or startle. It is one of the tetrad of symptoms of narcolepsy. During cataplexy, respiration and voluntary eye movements are not compromised. Consciousness is preserved.] </nowiki>

'''Physiologic-patterns''' <nowiki> [EEG graphoelements or rhythms that are considered normal. They only should be scored if the physician considers that they have a specific clinical significance for the recording.]</nowiki>

    * Rhythmic-activity-patterns <nowiki> [Not further specified] </nowiki>
    * Slow-alpha-variant-rhythm <nowiki> [Characteristic rhythms mostly at 4-5 Hz, recorded most prominently over the posterior regions of the head. Generally alternate, or are intermixed, with alpha rhythm to which they often are harmonically related. Amplitude varies but is frequently close to 50 micro V. Blocked or attenuated by attention, especially visual, and mental effort. Comment: slow alpha variant rhythms should be distinguished from posterior slow waves characteristic of children and adolescents and occasionally seen in young adults.] </nowiki>
    * Fast-alpha-variant-rhythm <nowiki> [Characteristic rhythm at 14-20 Hz, detected most prominently over the posterior regions of the head. May alternate or be intermixed with alpha rhythm. Blocked or attenuated by attention, especially visual, and mental effort.] </nowiki>

Recorded in 70 precent of normal children (3-5 years) and less then 10 precent of adults. Usually appear in the posterior regions and spread forward in younger age group, whereas they tend to appear in the frontal regions and spread backward in the older age group.] </nowiki>
    * Photic-driving <nowiki> [Physiologic response consisting of rhythmic activity elicited over the posterior regions of the head by repetitive photic stimulation at frequencies of about 5-30 Hz. Comments: term should be limited to activity time-locked to the stimulus and of frequency identical or harmonically related to the stimulus frequency. Photic driving should be distinguished from the visual evoked potentials elicited by isolated flashes of light or flashes repeated at very low frequency.] </nowiki>
    * Photomyogenic-response <nowiki> [A response to intermittent photic stimulation characterized by the appearance in the record of brief, repetitive muscular artifacts (spikes) over the anterior regions of the head. These often increase gradually in amplitude as stimuli are continued and cease promptly when the stimulus is withdrawn. Comment: this response is frequently associated with flutter of the eyelids and vertical oscillations of the eyeballs and sometimes with discrete jerking mostly involving the musculature of the face and head. (Preferred to synonym: photomyoclonic response).] </nowiki>
    * Arousal-pattern <nowiki> [Arousal pattern in children. Prolonged, marked high voltage 4-6/s activity in all leads with some intermixed slower frequencies, in children.] </nowiki>

K complexes occur during non-REM sleep, apparently spontaneously, or in response to sudden sensory / auditory stimuli, and are not specific for any individual sensory modality.] </nowiki>
    * POSTS-pattern <nowiki> [Positive occipital sharp transient of sleep. Sharp transient maximal over the occipital regions, positive relative to other areas, apparently occurring spontaneously during sleep. May be single or repetitive. Amplitude varies but is generally bellow 50 micro V.] </nowiki>

    * Other-physiologic-patterns


'''Uncertain-significant-patterns''' <nowiki> [EEG graphoelements or rhythms that resemble abnormal patterns but that are not necessarily associated with a pathology, and the physician does not consider them abnormal in the context of the scored recording (like normal variants and patterns).]</nowiki>

    * Sharp-transient-pattern
    * Wicket-spikes <nowiki> [Spike-like monophasic negative single waves or trains of waves occurring over the temporal regions during drowsiness that have an arcuate or mu-like appearance.

Small sharp spikes (SSS) of very short duration and low amplitude, often followed by a small theta wave, occurring in the temporal regions during drowsiness and light sleep. They occur on one or both sides (often asynchronously). The main negative and positive components are of about equally spiky character. Rarely seen in children, they are seen most often in adults and the elderly. Two thirds of the patients have a history of epileptic seizures. ] </nowiki>
    * Fourteen-six-Hz-positive-burst <nowiki> [Burst of arch-shaped waves at 13-17 Hz and/or 5-7-Hz but most commonly at 14 and or 6 Hz seen generally over the posterior temporal and adjacent areas of one or both sides of the head during sleep. The sharp peaks of its component waves are positive with respect to other regions. Amplitude varies but is generally below 75  micro V. Comments: (1) best demonstrated by referential recording using contralateral earlobe or other remote, reference electrodes. (2) This pattern has no established clinical significance.] </nowiki>
    * Six-Hz-spike-slow-wave <nowiki> [Spike and slow wave complexes at 4-7Hz, but mostly at 6 Hz occurring generally in brief bursts bilaterally and synchronously, symmetrically or asymmetrically, and either confined to or of larger amplitude over the posterior or anterior regions of the head.

    * SREDA <nowiki> [Subclinical rhythmic EEG discharge of adults. A rhythmic pattern seen in the adult age group, mainly in the waking state or drowsiness. Itconsists of a mixture of frequencies, often predominant in the theta range. The onset may be fairly abrupt with widespread sharp rhythmical theta and occasionally with delta activity. As to the spatial distribution, a maximum of this discharge is usually found over the centroparietal region and especially over the vertex. It may resemble a seizure discharge but is not accompanied by any clinical signs or symptoms.] </nowiki>
    * RTTD <nowiki> [Rhythmic temporal theta burst of drowsiness. Characteristic burst of 4-7 Hz waves frequently notched by faster waves, occurring over the temporal regions of the head during drowsiness. Synonym: psychomotor variant pattern.

'''EEG-artifacts''' <nowiki> [When relevant for the clinical interpretation, artifacts can be scored by specifying the type and the location.]</nowiki>

    * Biological-artifacts <nowiki> [Used with Findings-property/ tags]</nowiki>
        ** Eye-blinks <nowiki>[Fp1/Fp2 become electropositive with eye closure because the cornea is positively charged causing a negative deflection in Fp1/Fp2. If the eye blink is unilateral, consider prosthetic eye. If it is in F8 rather than Fp2 then the electrodes are plugged in wrong.]</nowiki>
        ** Eye-movements-horizontal <nowiki> [There is an upward deflection in the Fp2-F8 derivation, when the eyes move to the right side. In this case F8 becomes more positive and therefore. When the eyes move to the left, F7 becomes more positive and there is an upward deflection in the Fp1-F7 derivation.] </nowiki>
        ** Eye-movements-vertical <nowiki> [The EEG shows positive potentials (50-100 micro V) with bifrontal distribution, maximum at Fp1 and Fp2, when the eyeball rotated upward. The downward rotation of the eyeball was associated with the negative deflection. The time course of the deflections was similar to the time course of the eyeball movement.]</nowiki>
        ** Slow-eye-movements <nowiki> [Slow, rolling eye-movements, seen during drowsiness.]</nowiki>
        ** Chewing-artifact
        ** Sucking-artifact
        ** Glossokinetic-artifact <nowiki> [The tongue functions as a dipole, with the tip negative with respect to the base. The artifact produced by the tongue has a broad potential field that drops from frontal to occipital areas, although it is less steep than that produced by eye movement artifacts. The amplitude of the potentials is greater inferiorly than in parasagittal regions; the frequency is variable but usually in the delta range. Chewing and sucking can produce similar artifacts.] </nowiki>
        ** Rocking-patting-artifact <nowiki>[Quasi-rhythmical artefacts in recordings from infants caused by rocking/ patting.]</nowiki>
        ** Movement-artifact <nowiki> [Large amplitude artifact, with irregular morphology (usually resembling a slow-wave or a wave with complex morphology) seen in one or several channels, due to movement. If the causing movement is repetitive, the artifact might resemble a rhythmic EEG activity.] </nowiki>
        ** Respiration-artifact <nowiki> [Respiration can produce 2 kinds of artifacts. One type is in the form of slow and rhythmic activity, synchronous with the body movements of respiration and mechanically affecting the impedance of (usually) one electrode. The other type can be slow or sharp waves that occur synchronously with inhalation or exhalation and involve those electrodes on which the patient is lying.] </nowiki>
        ** Pulse-artifact <nowiki> [Occurs when an EEG electrode is placed over a pulsating vessel. The pulsation can cause slow waves that may simulate EEG activity. A direct relationship exists between ECG and the pulse waves (200-300 millisecond delay after ECG equals QRS complex).]</nowiki>
        ** ECG-artifact <nowiki> [Far-field potential generated in the heart. The voltage and apparent surface of the artifact vary from derivation to derivation and, consequently, from montage to montage. The artifact is observed best in referential montages using earlobe electrodes A1 and A2. ECG artifact is recognized easily by its rhythmicity/regularity and coincidence with the ECG tracing.] </nowiki>
        ** Sweat-artifact <nowiki> [Is a low amplitude undulating waveform that is usually greater than 2 seconds and may appear to be an unstable baseline.] </nowiki>
        ** EMG-artifact <nowiki> [Myogenic potentials are the most common artifacts. Frontalis and temporalis muscles (ex..: clenching of jaw muscles) are common causes. Generally, the potentials generated in the muscles are of shorter duration than those generated in the brain. The frequency components are usually beyond 30-50 Hz, and the bursts are arrhythmic.] </nowiki>
